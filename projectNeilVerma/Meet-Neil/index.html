				<h2>This is how <br>the journey started.</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>The first infatuation with brand development hit during the undergrad years when I was enrolled in the commerce stream with marketing as a major. Based on the course curriculum, I was infatuated with creating snazzy tag lines, conjuring company names albeit some are better left unsaid, and developing marketing strategies for local businesses. Little did I know that the branding traits were inherent, came somewhat natural, and probably something worth pursuing. But with l chose to spend a few years in Banking ... .Go figure!</p><br>
					<p>After a boring sting in banking, I embarked on a MBA program at Ivey and with marketing being a major again, the strong affinity towards all things brand related began again. The accountings, finance and operations courses pailed (not failed!) in comparison.
					</p><br>
					<p>After the completion of the program, I spent a decade or so merging banking with marketing where I was leading, managing and directing initiatives focussing on brand development, new product development, relationship management, offline marketing and of course digital strategy. Highlights were launching the Live Richly brand for Citi, developing the ICICI brand in Canada, and building the $100M insurance brand for Canadian Tire. </p><br>
					<p>But change was on the horizon. The corporate chapter came to end in 2012 for a number of reasons foremost among them being the need to remove myself from the race and do things that I really cherish. Lifestyle, independence, passion ... were on top of that list. The filtration process was already in full steam and the natural evolution was Brand Entrepreneurism + Creative Freedom. </p><br>
					<p>The initial, baby steps were niches sites which then led to full blown Ecommerce. The journey has been incredibly enlightening, humbling and enriching with crazy long hours – I said lifestyle was on top of the list and not shorter hours. The biggest gratification has been able to have the creative juices flowing with the creation of three major ecom brands. </p><br>
					<p>The development has involved: defining the brand’s (vision, mission, values), giving them direction (brand strategy, positioning and personality), providing them with an identity (corporate or product/service naming, visual identity guidance), expressing them (design strategy/ux, communications strategy planning, copywriting), and concluding with the evaluate of their performance (marketing research planning and execution). </p><br>
					<p>With this penchant for exploring, executing, and sharing that eBrandBuilders was born –a conduit for knowledge transfer. The mindset in its launch was to make it easier, seamless, and a natural progression for other ecommerce businesses to leverage brand development to 3x, 5x, or even 10x their revenue. Not with a digital course offering, but through an all inclusive, comprehensive 8 week incubator program.</p>
