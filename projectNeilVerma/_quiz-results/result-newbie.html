          <p>
            <span>20</span>years ago, when markets were dominated by the same few players, CEO’s went on a rampage in training to become brand masters.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This was the next level of competition, macro differentiation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            10 years ago, industry started swinging back towards product design and product functionality.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The good old days of real innovation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But as more business has moved to the digital universe, and competition is focused on speed and efficiency, and convenience, branding has once again become an afterthought.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Yet in digital, branding is the only big human presence that is completely missing from the competitive realm.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The biggest change in digital marketplace is not that a leader must be a technical master with a good understanding of product and product marketing, but for the first time ever, to dominate he or she must also take on the mantle of brand master while still being hyper-capable in product and marketing strategy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Indeed, if the first coming of branding and consumer psychology came 20 years ago, now that new markets have new ecosystems, a completely new world, as it matures the second, bigger coming of brand differentiation and implementation is on its way…at least for the new leaders of this world.
