								What is Ecom Branding, the 7C Method?
							</h2>
								
							<p>
								It’s Not another “how to” web marketing book, compiled from other people’s blogs.<br>
								It’s Not About traditional Growth Hacking, it’s about real blue-chip Brander Secrets, Modified by successful eCom CEOs based on real-world eCom use.<br>
								Its not a quick fix, it is a systematic PERMANENT FIX.<br>
								Its single fire for you to stoke growth that eliminates all the little fires you had to put out every day.

							<h2>
								Ecom Branding is NOT a Hack or a Shortcut, but a Major SMARTCUT
							</h2>
								
							<p>
								Real branding can’t be “hacked”, as it’s a detailed set of processes developed over 50 years but kept secret in ivory towers until now. Gone, however, are the misleading buzzwords, or the complex models, gone are the methods that only work for Bricks and Mortars or deep pocketed Branders. What remains is 400 pages of what amounts to 3 graduate-level courses in one, in real English, and step by step guides and visual models for understanding and implementation.
