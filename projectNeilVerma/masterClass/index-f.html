									Learn How to Create a Real Brand, from the Inside-Out
								</span>

								Starting with a Purpose. In this climate, the best way to engage consumers is to have the “inside-out” strategy of being driven by your brand purpose. But this can’t just be any initiative or set of principles. In order to truly resonate with consumers, your brand’s purpose must be the true core of your brand, and you must know how to demonstrate the relevancy of your purpose in your customers’ daily lives.

This is only possible when you build a community for you customers to interact within, and by providing value outside of products.  We’ll show you what options there are for that intangible value, and how for you to create it, too.

						“I’m grateful for the help I’ve been given in life, but in business, I’ve always been a self starter. So, | spent two years studying blog posts, and even hiring a CBO in 2015 to develop an eCommerce business, implementing everything |’d been told, and... created a very pretty Frankenstein in the process, that -based on post-launch revenues, alienated what little audience existed. Then | spent 7 weeks with eBB, empowered with their 7C Method rebranded from my insights and Values and 2 years later- you’ve heard of Charity Water, no?”

						<h3>
							Hi, I’m Neil Verma
						</h3>

						<p>
							I started my coaching career on the dark side. The big bad corporate world. I got my MBA from an Ivy League school. And consulted for many Fortune 500s.
						</p>

						<p>
							I finally saw the light. And like you, I caught the eCommerce bug. But like many in this field – I struggled.
						</p>

						<p>
							I couldn’t find a way to stand out in the sea of sameness. And before long, my eCommerce business was stuck in a whirlpool. Going nowhere.
						</p>

						<p>
							So I started to apply my “bag of tricks” from my brand consulting days. My store looked pretty. Oh so pretty. I even got some sales.
						</p>

						<p>
							But the growth I was seeking didn’t happen. I was stuck in a rut. And I didn’t know how to get out.
						</p>

						<p>
							Finally, after over 5 months of struggling daily. I stopped using the tactics I’d learnt in the corporate world. And started to model my eCommerce store after the principles I’d learnt.
						</p>

						<p>
							Like a snowball tumbling down a mountain. My business started to gain momentum. Within just 12 months I had sold my three eCommerce businesses for a 7 figure sum.
						</p>

						<p>
							And now? In the last 2.5 years alone. I’ve helped over 27 eCommerce businesses go from $’000s to $000,000s per year. In less than 12 months.
						</p>

						<p>
							Have a question? Email and I’ll be happy to answer it.
