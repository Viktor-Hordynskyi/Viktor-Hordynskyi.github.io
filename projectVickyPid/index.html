					When bringing new projects to the market, you need so much more than just the dollars of potential customers, you need their belief and support — because your first backers will be the ones to spread the buzz about you, and confront the skeptics.
				</p>
				<p>
					A friendly community is the best thing that can happen to your project, and this is what we do best: grow loyalty.
				</p>
				<p>
					We apply the proven marketing tactics of the crypto world to the world of crowdfunding, and achieve great results.

					Why use crypto tactics for crowdfunding and Indiegogo campaigns?
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					According to recent statistics, the cumulative amount of money pledged to funding projects on Kickstarter, between July 2012 and August 2018, was around 3.8 billion US dollars. Another 1.5 billion US dollars was raised through Indiegogo.
				</p>
				<p>
					While, in only the first five months of 2018, ICOs raised $13.7 billion, almost doubling the roughly $7 billion raised in 2017.
