    <h2>Opening Minds, Hearts, and Opportunities</h2>
    <p>More than two decades ago, a group of idealistic educators grappled with some tough questions. How do you make Jewish values, learning, and life relevant to the next generation? How do you instill a Jewish identity that expands horizons and leads to greater engagement with the world?  How do you create serious scholars who strive, but care deeply about one another and the world; who look to the future, but savor the here and now?</p>
<p>The answer was Gann Academy.</p>
<p>We are an independent Jewish high school in Waltham, drawing students from 22 communities and the full spectrum of Jewish observance. Our students are thinkers, questioners, seekers, creators, and mensches. Small classes and a 5:1 student-to-faculty ratio ensure every voice is heard and every mind, nurtured.</p>
<p>At Gann, the world is your classroom. You may find yourself testing water quality in the Sea of Galilee,  interning at a Harvard teaching hospital, or visiting Southern civil rights landmarks you studied in history class. Closer to home, our wide range of extra-curricular activities — athletics, the arts, and clubs— offer dozens of ways for students to explore, develop, and thrive.</p>
<p>Get ready to open up your mind and heart, make life-long friends, and work and play harder and more joyfully than you ever have before.<br />

    <div class="container">
      <p>Socrates had it right: it’s the questions that are at the heart of learning, and Gann students ask a lot of probing questions. Whether the setting is the classroom, lab, studio, or maker space, academics at Gann are collaborative, interdisciplinary, self-directed, and fun.</p>

          <p>Students are in the driver’s seat, in charge of their learning. Teachers are collaborators, facilitators, and guides. Lectures are rare, while hands-on, group work is the norm. Instruction focuses on the mastery of skills, not the simple acquisition of content. 
Our most important job is to impart the skills and habits that will serve our students throughout their lives: inquisitiveness, persistence, clear and flexible thinking, risk-taking, meaning making, ethical decisionmaking, and deep listening.

          <p>What are, and what will be, your passion? Computer Science, Philosophy, Arabic, 3D Modeling? At Gann, you’ll not only have a wide array of options, more than 125 classes are offered each year, but also the ability to deep dive into a
            subject and to learn skills taught by experts in the field.<br>
            <br>
            Take Computer Science for example. In ninth grade you fall in love with programming while taking CS Principles, learning the basics of object-oriented web app design. Next year you dive into the AP-level CS1 to tackle syntax, iteration, arrays, recursion, object-oriented programming, and sorting and searching algorithms. In CS2, you further your skills with advanced programming and circuit design, culminating in the design of a pipelined RISC processor.</p>

          <p>Gann puts a premium on experiential learning, inside and outside the classroom. You may learn about force and velocity by programming a tiny robot to traverse an obstacle course or create a museum exhibit about the history of disabilities as the culmination of your American history course.<br>
            <br>We build into your four years plenty of time for experiential learning beyond our campus. During Exploration week in the spring, the entire student body fans out across the country to volunteer, explore new places, and learn about themselves and the world. Every sophomore spends six weeks in Israel during the myIsrael experience. And Ma’avar, a six-week capstone project, serves as the punctuation mark of senior year.

The equivalent of six full-time staff members work on professional development.

About 90% of our faculty have advanced degrees, with a number of PhDs among them.<br>
            <br>We encourage our teachers to innovate, take risks, and constantly evolve their teaching as needs, technologies and pedagogical approaches change  — and they model these qualities for their students.

    <h3>Headed to the Best Colleges, Determined to Make a Better World</h3>
	  <p>Year after year, our students matriculate at the country’s top colleges. But we believe the most important measure of success is that our seniors land at the school that’s perfect for them.</p>
<p>Our college counselors begin from the premise that applying to college is a time of exploration and growth, not stress and anxiety. They support students through the entire process&mdash;whether they are heading straight to college or taking a gap year detour. Among colleges, Gann students have the reputation of being analytical, independent thinkers and strong communicators, engaged with their community and the world. </p>

					<p>On day one, you’ll be paired with a faculty member who will look out for you and ease your transition to high school. Your advisor will help you choose classes and strike that balance between  academics and everything else, while always being available to lend an ear or a shoulder. Your Advisory group&mdash;eight to ten students&mdash;meet twice a week throughout your four years for discussions, activities, and workshops. </p>
<p>For many students, Advisory is central to their Gann experience. It’s a judgment-free zone where they grapple with ideas&mdash;big and small&mdash;, entertain diverse viewpoints, form close friendships, and learn to advocate for themselves and their values. </p>

					
					
                  <p>From day one, you'll be paired with a faculty member who will look out for you and help facilitate your transition to high school. Your advisor serves as a point-person during your time at Gann. He or she will help you choose classes, find a balance between academics and life outside of school, or just meet to chat.</p>
                  <p>Advisory groups &mdash; eight to ten students &mdash; meet twice a week for discussions, group activities, and workshops. There, you'll talk about the rhythm of the school year, share your thoughts on current events, and explore big question of who you are and who you'll become. You'll learn to advocate for yourself, and to appreciate diverse viewpoints. And, you'll make long-term friendships with a small group of peers who will stay together for your four years at Gann. </p>

      <h2>COMMUNITY</h2>
      Gann friendships are often life-long friendships and we take some of the credit. We're deliberate and creative about community building, kicking off the year with an all-school, getting-to-know-each-other retreat that sets the tone for what's to come.  Every week offers opportunities to learn, celebrate, and hang out with each other&mdash;from student-run assemblies to holiday celebrations to 24-hour Shabbatons&mdash;grade-wide gatherings that are at once spiritual and playful. Special programs like our week-long exploration projects and the six-week Israel trip further bond us to one another.<br/>
